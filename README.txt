# TwoSigma

Step 1: Clean up the features.
	Fill NA values
	Decide what features should be added/removed (PCA, correlations)
	Explore relations/clustering of different stocks

Step 2: Model selection
	Test out simple models (linear regression, neural networks, random forest, K-nearest neighbors)
	Obs: train different predictive models for each cluster of stocks (maybe different model for each cluster)
	Ensemble taking weighted combinations of different models.
	Test the performance naive models
	Evaluate performance of different
